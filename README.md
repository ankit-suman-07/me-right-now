## About me 👋

### Introduction 🙋‍♂️
Hi, I'm **Ankit Suman**, a passionate coder, an artist and a creator at heart. I go by the belief that I can learn only if I build something and hence you will always see me working on something.

### Job 💼

  - Software Development Intern at [*CACTUS COMMUNICATIONS*](https://cactusglobal.com/). 
  - Helping build [Paperpal](https://paperpal.com/home), a comprehensive AI writing toolkit that helps students and researchers around the world. 
  - Creating APIs using SpringBoot and JAVA.
  - Writing test-cases using *Mockito* and *JUnit* to keep the code monitored.
  - Also helping fellow interns and new joinee with the onboarding process and explaining them the code I've worked on.

### Learnings on the job
  - Ask as many questions as you can to understand the requirements wholly before starting working on it.
  - Test-Driven Development might seem daunting at first, but it offers a structured approach to writing code that can significantly improve code quality, encourage better design, and reduce bugs in the long run.
  - You can never know everything, but always be open to learning.
  - Communication is not about knowing a certain language, but it's about being able to understand what others are telling and being able to convey whatever we want to say.
